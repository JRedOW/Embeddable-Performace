Over the last 20 years user customization of a software's execution has become an increasingly common feature. Spurred on by the rising prevalence of the internet\cite{owidinternet}\cite{digital:2021}\cite{digital:2023} and increasing power of web browsers\cite{caniuse:features} we have seen an expansion of web browser usage. This is important as these web browser, which are based on an embeddable language know as JavaScript, have given users an expectation of customizability in their software.

As embeddable languages have become an increasingly important part of modern software design, their performance has had an increasing impact on the overall performance of the software environment. Therefore, deciding upon a language to use in your system must take into account not only the use case, but the performance of the language. This paper attempts to provide developers with the necessary information to make their decision on embeddable languages.
